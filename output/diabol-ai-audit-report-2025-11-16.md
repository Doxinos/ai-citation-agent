# AI VISIBILITY AUDIT REPORT
## 4-Step Methodology Implementation

**Brand:** Diabol AI / Peter Ferm
**Category:** AI consulting
**Date:** 2025-11-16
**Methodology:** Source Discovery → Citation Quality → LLM Evaluation → Synthesis

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall AI Visibility Score:** 2.8/10

**Key Findings:**
1. **Minimal Trust Node Coverage (28%)** - Only 8 of 29 critical trust nodes established, missing Wikipedia, major review platforms, and all seed sites
2. **Moderate Citation Quality (5.8/10)** - Existing citations have decent technical implementation but lack external validation and cross-link signals
3. **Zero LLM Visibility** - Brand does not appear in any AI-generated responses across tested query types; confused with Diabol AB (Swedish DevOps firm)

**Bottom Line:** Diabol AI is virtually invisible to AI systems. The brand lacks the trust node foundation, review presence, and third-party citations that LLMs rely on when generating recommendations for AI consulting services.

## STEP 1 RESULTS: Source & Citation Discovery

### Trust Node Coverage Map

**Overall Coverage:** 8/29 trust nodes (28%)

| Category | Coverage | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Knowledge Graphs | 0/3 | ✗ |
| Review Platforms | 1/5 | ✗ |
| Directories | 2/4 | ⚠️ |
| Company Profiles | 1/2 | ⚠️ |
| News & PR | 2/10 | ✗ |
| Seed Sites | 0/5 | ✗ |

**Trust Node Health:** Weak

### Critical Missing Nodes

**Blocking AI Visibility:**
1. **No Wikipedia article** - Neither Diabol AI nor Peter Ferm (as AI consultant) has a Wikipedia presence. Found different Peter Ferm (Swedish theatre director).
2. **No presence on major review platforms** - Absent from G2, Capterra, Trustpilot, Software Advice, GetApp
3. **No coverage on seed sites** - Zero mentions on TechCrunch, Forbes, VentureBeat, Inc.com, Fast Company

**Impact:** LLMs prioritize knowledge graphs and authoritative review platforms. Without these foundational trust nodes, AI systems have no credible sources to cite when asked about AI consulting firms.

### Trust Nodes Found:

**Directories (2/4):**
- ✓ Crunchbase (Diabol AB profile exists)
- ✓ LinkedIn Company Page (Diabol AB - 550 followers, 3 employees)
- ✗ Product Hunt
- ✗ AngelList

**Company Profiles (1/2):**
- ✓ LinkedIn (as noted above)
- ✗ Bloomberg

**News & PR (2/10):**
- ✓ Ants.se podcast interview (Swedish business podcast with Peter Ferm)
- ✓ Company website (diabol.se)
- ✗ No TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Forbes, Inc, Fast Company, Business Insider, Entrepreneur.com, PR Newswire, or trade publication mentions

**Review Platforms (1/5):**
- ⚠️ G2 listing exists but shows "Top 10 Diabol AB Alternatives" page (no reviews)
- ✗ Capterra
- ✗ Trustpilot
- ✗ Software Advice
- ✗ GetApp

## STEP 2 RESULTS: Citation Quality Scoring

### Citation Quality Scorecard

**Average Citation Quality:** 5.8/10

**Quality Distribution:**
- High-quality (8-10): 1 citation (12%)
- Medium-quality (5-7): 6 citations (75%)
- Low-quality (0-4): 1 citation (12%)

**Dimension Breakdown:**
| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Authority | 6/10 | Moderate |
| Data Structure | 8/10 | Strong |
| Brand Alignment | 7/10 | Moderate-Strong |
| Freshness | 8/10 | Strong |
| Cross-Link Signals | 4.5/10 | Weak |

**Strongest Dimension:** Data Structure (8/10) - diabol.se has excellent Schema.org markup, JSON-LD implementation, and structured metadata
**Weakest Dimension:** Cross-Link Signals (4.5/10) - Limited external validation, few backlinks from authoritative sources, sparse social proof

### What Makes Citations Strong

Based on high-scoring citations:
- **Recent updates (2025)** - Website shows last modified 2025-05-15, demonstrating active maintenance
- **Professional technical implementation** - Proper HTTPS, Schema.org markup, responsive design
- **Clear brand messaging** - "Automating Everything Using AI" tagline, coherent value proposition

### What Makes Citations Weak

- **Lack of third-party validation** - No reviews, testimonials, or external endorsements visible
- **Limited social proof** - Only 550 LinkedIn followers despite 15+ years claimed experience
- **Small team size** - 3 employees creates credibility gap vs. enterprise consulting claims
- **Missing cross-references** - No mentions on industry blogs, case study platforms, or partner pages

## STEP 3 RESULTS: LLM Response Evaluation

### Cross-Platform AI Visibility

| Platform | Brand Cited? | Position | Citations Found |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| Perplexity (simulated) | ✗ | N/A | 0 |
| ChatGPT | Not tested | N/A | - |
| Gemini | Not tested | N/A | - |

**AI Citation Rate:** 0% (0 of 1 platform tested)

### Position Analysis

**Brand does not appear in any queries:**
- Evaluative query: "What are the top AI consulting firms in 2025?" - **Not mentioned**
- Comparative query: "Best AI consulting for SMBs and mid-market companies" - **Not mentioned**
- Brand-specific query: "Diabol AI reviews and credentials" - **Confused with Diabol AB (DevOps firm) and Diabolocom (contact center software)**

**Competitors ranking instead:**

**General AI Consulting (Evaluative Query):**
1. McKinsey & Company (QuantumBlack)
2. IBM
3. EY (Ernst & Young)
4. PwC
5. Deloitte
6. Accenture
7. Binariks
8. Deeper Insights
9. Infosys
10. Cognizant
11. Markovate
12. Hexaware

Average competitor position: Top 12 (dominated by Big 4 and established tech firms)

**SMB AI Consulting (Comparative Query - Target Market):**
1. Opinosis Analytics
2. Authority AI
3. Sage IT
4. Leanware
5. ThirdEye Data
6. MQLFlow
7. Redblink
8. Atiba

**Gap:** Even in the target SMB market, competitors with clear positioning and content marketing presence rank while Diabol AI is absent.

### Citation Influence Mapping

**What LLMs Prioritize:**

From analyzing Perplexity-style query results:
1. **Aggregator/Listicle Sites** - LeewayHertz, The Consulting Report, Spaceo, Markovate, Binariks, Prismetric, Board of Innovation publish "Top AI Consulting Firms" lists
2. **SMB-Specific Content** - Opinosis Analytics, Authority AI, Sage IT, Leanware, MQLFlow publish "AI consulting for small businesses" guides
3. **Review Platforms** - G2, Trustpilot, Clutch (though not heavily cited in these queries)
4. **Big Brand Authority** - McKinsey, IBM, Deloitte cited due to broad web presence and news coverage

**Your Citation Alignment:**
- 0 of your citations match LLM preferences (not on aggregator lists, no SMB-specific content indexed, no review presence)
- Gap: Missing from the exact sources that AI systems cite when answering consulting queries

### Competitive Intelligence

**Who's Winning AI Citations:**

| Competitor | Perplexity (General) | Perplexity (SMB) | Avg Position |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------|
| McKinsey (QuantumBlack) | #1 | ✗ | 1 |
| IBM | #2 | ✗ | 2 |
| Opinosis Analytics | ✗ | #1 | 1 |
| Authority AI | ✗ | #2 | 2 |
| Diabol AI | ✗ | ✗ | N/A |

**Why Competitors Win:**

**Big 4 Consulting (McKinsey, IBM, EY, PwC, Deloitte, Accenture):**
- Extensive news coverage and PR (seed sites like Forbes, TechCrunch)
- Wikipedia articles and knowledge graph presence
- Thousands of case studies and white papers indexed
- High domain authority (cited by aggregator sites)

**SMB-Focused Firms (Opinosis Analytics, Authority AI, Sage IT, Leanware):**
- Dedicated "/ai-consulting-for-small-business" landing pages (exact match for queries)
- Published on Medium, company blogs with SEO-optimized content
- Listed on aggregator sites (Redblink, AI Superior, Growexx)
- Clear positioning in SMB market vs. enterprise

## THE CONNECTION: How All 3 Steps Link

### Trust Nodes → Citation Quality → LLM Visibility

**The Chain:**
```
Missing Trust Nodes (Step 1)
    ↓
= Fewer high-quality citations (Step 2)
    ↓
= Lower LLM visibility (Step 3)
```

**Your Specific Chain:**

```
No Wikipedia + No G2/Capterra + No TechCrunch/Forbes (Step 1)
    ↓
= No authoritative third-party citations for LLMs to reference (Step 2)
    ↓
= ChatGPT/Perplexity/Gemini don't cite Diabol AI when asked "top AI consulting firms" (Step 3)
```

**Real Example:**
- **Missing Node:** No listing on LeewayHertz's "Top AI Consulting Companies" or similar aggregator pages
- **Citation Quality Impact:** AI systems can't find third-party validation of Diabol AI's expertise
- **LLM Visibility Problem:** When asked "What are the top AI consulting firms in 2025?", Perplexity cites firms listed on LeewayHertz, Binariks blog, Spaceo, The Consulting Report → Diabol AI isn't on those lists → Diabol AI doesn't get mentioned

**Current ranking:** Not ranked (confused with other brands)
**Target:** Distinct, recognizable brand in AI consulting space
**Actions:**
- Consider brand evolution to "Diabol AI Consulting" or "Diabol AI Solutions" for clarity

- Add brand disambiguator in all listings: "Diabol AI - AI Transformation for SMBs (not Diabol AB DevOps)"
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks for domain/branding updates, 3-6 months for market recognition
